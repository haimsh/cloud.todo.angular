1. describe what was hard
The real hardness was to figure out how the cookies work. Only after lot of tries I
figure out my site is already working in FF, and then I could search for differences
between FF and Chrome. In case in the future you tell students to implement site with
cookies, inform them that some browsers don't keep cookies for localhost domain.

2. describe what was easy
The easy part was to implement the basic "single user" on-cloud site. It required
only few changes on the original code.

3. general comments about the course
Regarding the exam, I understand the pros of its current structure, but I want to
mention that it bothers that you can hardly get 95 with this structure.
