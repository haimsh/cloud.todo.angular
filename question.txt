1. XSS: The site is safe against XSS since it sends its data via
JSON, so during sending it write correctly special characters. In
addition, later the server handle the input as object, and never
"eval" it.

2. XSRF: The site is safe against XSRF since in addition to
authentication via cookies, it set the session id via special
"x-id" HTTP header. This cause XSRF request to fail authentication.

All those above answers are not exactly accurate, since our http
protocol is http and not https (ex4 server don't support it), so
all the communication between server and client is exposed (including
password and session id).
