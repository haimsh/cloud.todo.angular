Tester test the following tests:

1. register:
    a. registering 2 users (success)
    b. try to register again exists user (failure)
2. login:
    a. login with both users (success)
    b. login with wrong password (failure)
    c. login with non-exists user (failure)

3. data:
For both successful logins (from 2.a.) the tester take the
session id, and test the database:
    a. Get: tested after each change to db (with expected value).
        i. In addition, tested without session identifier (failure)
    b. post:
        i. post new item (success)
        ii. post with exist item (failure)
        iii. post second item (success)
    c. put:
        i. change item completed status (success)
        ii. changing back (success)
        iii. change item name (success)
        iv. change non-exists item (failure)
    d. delete:
        i. manually delete item (success)
        ii. delete all when all item are active (success, do nothing)
        iii. delete non-exists item (failure)
        iv. delete all when exist completed items (success)
        v. delete non-exists when list is empty (failure)

The tests for both user interleave in time, when every TIME_OUT_DELAY each user
send change request, and in order not to overload the server, the second user use
1.5, 2.5, 3.5 * TIME_OUT_DELAY.

One thing I don't test - request with the session id after it expired. I tested
it manually, but adding it to the testing routine will make each test very long.

I encounter problems enabling tests for the front-end, but the ex. requirements are:
"a tester for all your the HTTP APIs" - means the back-end. I even couldn't run the
original todomvc app front-end karma tests.
