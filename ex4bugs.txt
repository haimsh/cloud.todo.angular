c9728ea3c0a7cc6d5e988082ff7c7c5e0e2e02a1 is the submitted version of ex4, current
master is published to npm as version 0.0.7 which is used by my ex5.

Some of the commits are of advanced version, since each time I change the code, I had to
republish to npm. Others changes regarding the npm publishing are Readme.mk file and the
package.json file (with its history).

Here are main changes (order by the "file changes" tab in the above link,
line numbers refer to the old numbering), which refer to change in original ex4
code files:

miniExpress.js
1. Safe invoking of "user-given" function by app.use(...) - adding try-catch (line 88).

2. miniExpress.static() - stupid bag in the condition checking whether the
wanted file is in source dir. I got penalty in Ex3, and since this service is
going to be used on the web (Heroku), I fixed it (line 370).

3. cookieParser() - don't try to parse the cookies if there are none (lines 414-418).

4. json() and bodyParser() - in old flow, when type is not json, call next immediately,
but missing return, cause (after next end execution) the flow to still try and parse
the body, and then next was called again (NEW lines 438, 462).

5. json() should parse even if content type is "application/json<and some more details>",
not require only "application/json" with no additional words (line 428).


miniHttp.js
6. Added status code of 400 to list - this is not bug, it wasn't require on
previous ex (NEW line 23).

7. Headers split of key-value used string.split(":", 2). However, unlike other
languages, "a:b:c".split(":",2) is ["a","b"], not ["a","b:c"], so I had to
fix it (line 246).
